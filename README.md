# 911-emergency_calls-Data-Capstone-Project
This project incorporates use of several data visualization and data analysis libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib and seaborn etc. This project is very useful in analyzing the latitude and longitude coordinates of a person who is suffering emergency conditions due to various reasons like Fire conditions due to gas leak,vehicle accidents due to traffic and personal emergencies like health issues.Overall,the dataset contains around 1 lakh enteries of diverse people living in a particular area with their date and time-frame of emergency dually noted. Through this project,I have tried to analyze on which month of year and on which day of a week,the emergencies are likely to happen so that various organizations can provide help to these people as soon as possible. ALong with this,we will also get an idea about which emergency condition occurred the most in this particular area which gives the opportunity to improvise and take several measures in order to prevent these conditions.
